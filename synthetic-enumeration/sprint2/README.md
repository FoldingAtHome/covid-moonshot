### Sprint 2 synthetic purchasing

Results files accessed from folding at home server 10am BST 25-08-2020.  
3363 molecules analysed (4018 expanded stereoisomers) from second covid-moonshot sprint. 


### Identifying compounds for purchasing
Compounds filtered to purchase molecules with predicted affinity improvements of 1 kcal/mol, relative to molecule `TRY-UNI-2eddb1ff-7`

* Molecule `EN300-1940535` removed, as furan less preferable than comparible (in both structure and predicted affinity `EN300-330332`

Following molecules were removed due to alkyl-bromide residues
* `EN300-1274653`
* `EN300-70105` 
* `EN300-1915724`
* `EN300-1909681`
* `EN300-1274638`
* `EN300-1910987`
* `EN300-701252`
* `EN300-1274639`
* `EN300-1914939`

Molecules flagged for consideration are those containing ester functional group
